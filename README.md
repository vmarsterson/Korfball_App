# Fantasy Korfball App

This app is a personal project in which I am attempting to build my first Android project.

The focus of the app is to provide statistics and eventually gamify scores from real life korfball games, encouraging users to follow scores from other teams in their club and predict top scorers etc. 

## Project status

-- UNDER CONSTRUCTION --

This app is a still a work in progress and therefore does not at all reflect the final project yet.

## Getting started

1. You can clone the git repository project to your local machine: 
`git@github.com:vmarsterson/Korfball_App.git` 

2. Build and run on Android Studios as usual

## Technologies

The app includes technologies such as:

+ Kotlin 
+ Firebase
+ Java
